I'm a Software Engineer with 10+ years of hands on experience.
I have built live demos and installations for key customers, museums and companies

I worked as a developer on image processing and visualization applications, as a decision maker on technology, frameworks and tools for real-time systems on multiple platforms: Linux, Windows, Android and Arduino.

In the past, I worked for 2 Israeli startups:
Powermat, who developed the first wireless charging solution;
PrimeSense, who invented the Kinect, and sold to Apple.

I have M.Sc and B.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering from the Hebrew University.
My research focus is on AI, Computer Vision, Image Processing and Numerical Analysis.
