I'm currently a Software Lead at a Stealth-mode Robotics company,
for the past 2 years I have built live demos for key customers using C++, C# and Javascript.

As a decision maker on technology, frameworks and tools, I developed infrastructure for 5+ systems of real-time image processing and visualization using client-server on multiple platforms: Linux, Windows, Android and Arduino.

In the past, I worked as a Software Engineer at 2 Israeli startups:
Powermat, who developed the first wireless charging solution;
PrimeSense, who invented the Kinect, and recently sold to Apple.

I have M.Sc and B.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering from the Hebrew University.
My focus is on AI, Computer Vision, Image Processing and Numerical Analysis.
