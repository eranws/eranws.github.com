Hi,
My name is Eran Weissenstern.
I'm an artist, engineer, and a [self-referencer]( "This is a tool tip" ).
I seek for the boundaries between imaginary and real, trying to bridge between human and machine.

You can read about some of my past projects [here](#projects), or see my [github](https://github.com/eranws/) for more up-to-date projects i'm currently doing.
