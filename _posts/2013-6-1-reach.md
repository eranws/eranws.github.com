# Gesture-based interface with enhanced features 
# Abstract
# A method includes presenting, on a display coupled to a computer, an image of a keyboard comprising multiple keys, and receiving a sequence of three-dimensional (3D) maps including a hand of a user positioned in proximity to the display. An initial portion of the sequence of 3D maps is processed to detect a transverse gesture performed by a hand of a user positioned in proximity to the display, and a cursor is presented on the display at a position indicated by the transverse gesture. While presenting the cursor in proximity to the one of the multiple keys, one of the multiple keys is selected upon detecting a grab gesture followed by a pull gesture followed by a release gesture in a subsequent portion of the sequence of 3D maps.

# Zoom-based gesture user interface 

# A method includes arranging, by a computer, multiple interactive objects as a hierarchical data structure, each node of the hierarchical data structure associated with a respective one of the multiple interactive objects, and presenting, on a display coupled to the computer, a first subset of the multiple interactive objects that are associated with one or more child nodes of one of the multiple interactive objects. A sequence of three-dimensional (3D) maps including at least part of a hand of a user positioned in proximity to the display is received, and the hand performing a transverse gesture followed by a grab gesture followed by a longitudinal gesture followed by an execute gesture is identified in the sequence of three-dimensional (3D) maps, and an operation associated with the selected object is accordingly performed.

Reach is Primesense's TV control paradigm, that demonstrates a concept of direct media access, using natural gestures.
