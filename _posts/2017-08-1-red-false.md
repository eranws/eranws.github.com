A compiler I wrote in 3 days in less than 50 lines of code, for an esoteric language - FALSE, using another language, Red.

I have found this journey in the work of esoteric languages interesting and educational. 
Even for the seasoned programmer, most of development is done using _some_ language, at the level of variables and functions, mostly writing procedures, classes and interfaces.

Writing a compiler means to understand language itself - quite mind boggling; rarely you will need to know how functions work, or need to define the control-flow itself.

I am working on a mini tutorial to show how FALSE can be built starting from the concept of calculator, simply adding numbers - and extending it with words - variables and functions, up to a full blown compiler.
