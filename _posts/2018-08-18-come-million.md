The “Come-Million!” project is a massive sculpture built as an Honoraria project for the Burning Man festival in 2018 at Black Rock City, Nevada.

The sculpture was built by a collective of artists, dreamers, engineers and wide range of people from the local burner community. It is 20 Meter long and 7 meters high. It is covered with 20,000 light emitting LEDs that sit on a crafted steel-frame. It offers delightful, colorful animations full of light, that reacts and respond to its surroundings.
